# Terrorism Research and Dashboard

**Project Name:** Terrorism Research and Dashboard  
**Partner:** GMU Terrorism, Transnational Crime, and Corruption Center (TraCCC)

## Overview
The **Terrorism Research and Dashboard** project leverages data from the **Global Terrorism Trends and Analysis Center (GTTAC)** to develop an interactive dashboard that visualizes critical trends in global terrorism from 2018 to 2023. This tool is designed to provide actionable insights into the frequency and distribution of terrorist incidents, tactics used, weapon types, and the demographics of victims and perpetrators. The goal is to support researchers, policymakers, and security analysts in understanding terrorism patterns and developing effective counterterrorism strategies.

## Objectives
The project aims to address:
- vital research questions
- Develop Tableau Dashboard. The accompanying dashboard offers an intuitive interface for users to dynamically explore the data, enabling them to filter by region, tactic, weapon type, and more, providing valuable insights for academic and policy-focused audiences.

## Research Questions:
The project aims to address nine key research questions, including:
1. **Which regions or countries recorded the most terrorist incidents from 2018 to 2023?**  
2. **Which months saw the highest number of people killed and wounded during the same period?**  
3. **Which ten groups were responsible for the highest number of casualties (people killed and wounded) from 2018 to 2023?**  
4. **What types of tactics (e.g., suicide attacks, bombings, ambushes) were most frequently used from 2018 to 2023?**  
5. **Which ten groups employed these tactics the most, and how has their use of these tactics changed from 2018 to 2023?**  
6. **What are the most commonly used weapon types (e.g., firearms, explosives, UAVs, melee weapons) in terrorist incidents?**  
7. **Which five groups most frequently used weapons like firearms, IEDs, rockets, and UAVs from 2018 to 2023?**  
8. **Which victim categories (e.g., civilians, military personnel, politicians) were most frequently targeted in terrorist incidents?**  
9. **What are the similarities and differences between the tactics of Iran-backed and jihadist terrorist groups?**



## Features
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize terrorist incidents by region, tactics, and weapon types, filtered by time period.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Explore data trends related to terrorist activities, including incident frequency, casualties, and tactics.
- **User-Centric Design**: Developed with a focus on usability, making it accessible for researchers, policymakers, and analysts.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Data Analysis**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Dashboard Development**: Tableau, AWS EC2, AWS Lambda, AWS S3
- **Data Source**: GTTAC dataset (2018-2023)
